links = rigid bodies
connected together by joints
actuation causes joints to move

open-chain connections = all joints actuated
closed-chain loops = subset of joints may be actuated

actuators = DC/AC motors, stepper motors, shape memory alloys, pneumatics/hydraulics

most motors are fast w/ low torque -> leads to necessity for speed->torque conversion w/ gears, cable drives, belts, pulleys, chains, sprockets

sensors -> encoders/potentiometers/resolvers measure displacement
tachometers measure velocity
vision-only cameras
RGB-D cameras (depth)
laser range finders
